# TaskToolCmd

TaskToolCmd is a task/to-do manager that runs from the command line and is written in Java. It is just a programming exercise to help me learn Java programming. It is posted here so that others learning Java might find it useful. I'm not making any claims for it, and it is possibly not the best Java.

TaskToolCmd is a command line version of [TaskTool-java](https://github.com/rwaddilove/tasktool-java), which is a Java version of [TaskTool](https://github.com/rwaddilove/TaskTool), which was written in Python as a learning exercise. (Last year I spent some time learning Python. This year I'm learning Java.)

### Running TaskToolCmd

Load it into your Java IDE and run it. The IDE will create the .class files, you can then run it from the command line (in the right folder) with 'java TaskToolCmd'. See your IDE for compiling it into a .jar file. Afterwards, you can then use 'java -jar TaskToolCmd' at the command line (in the right folder of course).

'java -jar TaskToolCmd help' will show all the commands (you can, of course, read the source file too).
